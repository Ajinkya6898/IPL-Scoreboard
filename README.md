Hi, here is my one of the first application which I build using React.

<h1>About the Website :- </h1>
<p>Here you can see the scoreboard of Tata IPL 2022.
The match is betwwen the two most successful teams of the IPL history. CSK VS MI.</p>

<p>You can update the runs score by the csk by just clicking on the buttons.
I have also added the functionality where you can change the wickets and over as well for that you have to click on respective buttons.</p>

<h3>Sample Photo</h3>
